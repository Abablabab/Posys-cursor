My installer (and copy of) Michiel de Boer (Posy)'s mouse cursor theme available
at http://www.michieldb.nl/other/cursors/

The cursors do not state a license, and are provided freely and anonymously, so
I do not believe I am in any violation by including them - mostly for my own
convenience.

I wrote the installer because windows 11 didn't like the installer he provided
